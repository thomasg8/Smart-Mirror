# Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror

Below is a screenshot of the smart mirror display. This project is in active development and the physical mirror is scheduled to be built in Febuary. The video and clock are updated every 10 milleseconds, and the other display data is updated every 30 minutes.

To run this code, you need a token.pickle file from google to access your google calendar (https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python), as well as the calendar ids for your calendars. In addition, you will need a dark sky api key (https://darksky.net/dev) and a newsapi apy key (https://newsapi.org/).
